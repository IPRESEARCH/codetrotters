    <p>
        <b>Grace Brewster Murray Hope</b> (December 9, 1906 - January 1,1992),<b> Grace Brewster Murray</b>, was an american
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank">computer scientist</a> and U.S. Navy Rear
        admiral. She was one of the firts programers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, invented the first compiler
        for a computer programing lenguage, and was one of those who popularized the ide of machine-independent programing
        langage, and was one of those whopopolirized the idea of machine-independent programing lenguages which led to the
        development of <b>COBOL</b>, one of the first-high languages    
    </p>

    <p>
        Owing to her accomplishments and her navalrank, she is sometimes referred as "Amazing Grace". The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke
        class guided-missile destroyer <b>USS Hopper</b> (DDG-70) is named for her, as is the <b>Cray XE6 "Hopper"</b> supercomputer
        at <b>NERSC</b>.

        <p>Hopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary
            Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church. Her great-grandfather,
            Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.</p>

        <p>Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an
            alarm clock worked, and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was
            then limited to one clock). For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield,
            New Jersey. Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test scores in
            Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. <b>She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.</b></p>

        <p>In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Oystein Ore. Her dissertation, <i>New Types of Irreducibility Criteria</i>,
            was published that same year. Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate
            professor in 1941.</p>

            <h3>World War II</h3>
            <a name="WorldWar" </a>

                <p>Hopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in the war. She was at age 34, too old to enlist, and her weight
                    to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician she was
                    a mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort. During World War II in 1943,
                    Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve, one
                    of many women to volunteer to serve in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAVES" target="_blank">WAVES</a>.
                    She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds (54 kg). She
                    reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton,
                    Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the <em>Bureau of Ships Computation Project</em> <!--para italics usar em en vez de i-->                  at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff
                    headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken" target="_blank">Howard H. Aiken</a>                    H. Aiken. Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence
                    Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined
                    due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. <b>Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.</b></p>

                <h3>COBOL</h3>
                <a name="COBOL"></a>

                    <p>In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day
                        conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper served as a technical
                        consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee
                        that defined the new language <b>COBOL</b> (an acronym for
                        <b>CO</b>mmon <b>B</b>usiness-<b>O</b>riented <b>L</b>anguage). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC
                            language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. <b>Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.</b></p>

                    <p>From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's
                        Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. She developed
                        validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the
                        entire Navy.</p>
